2. **Random Password Generation:** SecurePass utilizes a secure randomization algorithm to generate unique passwords with high entropy.
3. **Password Strength Indicator:** Provides a visual indicator of the generated password's strength based on commonly accepted criteria.
4. **Clipboard Integration:** Users can easily copy generated passwords to their clipboard for convenient usage.
5. **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.
